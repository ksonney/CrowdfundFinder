# Coopsy is/will be a co-op style patreon and etsy replacement.

Please add issues to cover the basic functionality, written as *User Stories.* Some examples of this is :

"As a Creator, I want to offer multiple membership levels" 
"As a Patron, I want to only pay once a month to all my creators"
"As a Seller, I want to be able to set a prices per item"

There is a lot of ground to cover, and a lot of problems to be worked out. This repository is for tracking just that, and then building the code to go with it. 

There are Several *User Roles* to consider for this project

- A *Creator* produces content at multiple tiers for subscribers
- A *Seller* sells items outside of a subscription model
- A *Patron* pays to support *Creators* and access the subscription content
- A *Buyers* buys items from *Sellers*
- An *Admin* Manages the whole site 
- A *Moderators* Manages discussions, comments, etc
- A *User* is a catch-all role for all of the above.

When writing user stories, consider the use case for each. While there will be overlaps in these definitions, specific feature requests should have a specific role in mind. For example, a *Creator* would also be a *Moderator* for their personal area(s). 

In cases where a shared function is needed for all roles, the *User* role should be specified.
